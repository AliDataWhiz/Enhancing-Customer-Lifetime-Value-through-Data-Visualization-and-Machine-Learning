# Enhancing-Customer-Lifetime-Value-through-Data-Visualization-and-Machine-Learning
Explore how data visualization and ML can boost Customer Lifetime Value in vehicle insurance. Python-based analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
This project focuses on data visualization and machine learning techniques applied to a Vehicle Insurance dataset. With the primary goal of enhancing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), the dataset, featuring various customer and insurance-related features, undergoes analysis and preprocessing. Outliers are identified and removed, with CLV as the target variable. Through Python-based visualization using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, insights are gained to inform the construction of an ML model aimed at maximizing CLV, vital for long-term business success in the insurance industry.
